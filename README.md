# ZicoBadges

Zero Knowledge Badges for web3 users

Part of EthDenver 2022 ðŸ™Œ

# Goal 

DAOsâ€™ activities are mostly based on Discord today. Discussion on proposals, strategy
definitions, grant distributions and, more broadly, the coordination between participants
and contributors happen via Discord.

DAOs struggle a lot to bridge the gap between the off-chain nature of their activities on
Discord and the distribution of on-chain rewards. For example, when it comes to distribute
NFT airdrops or other types of rewards (meme contest or POAPs) or when it comes to
distribute grant to individuals via ERC20 tokens the problem becomes obvious. The routine
procedure is to collect address via Google Forms, Airtables or Typeforms that ask you for a
combination of off-chain verification (it can range from whatâ€™s your discord username to
more complex oAuth2 verification mechanism) and on-chain verification (again, ranging
from simple questions such as Whatâ€™s your Ethereum address? to more complex message
signing verifications).
This entire process is cumbersome to manage for Daos and, furthermore, represents a
serious privacy threat for users as they are associating their off-chain profile to on-chain
identity. Essentially, they are doing a Faustanian pact trading their privacy for rewards.
The solution we are proposing is the issuance of ZK-based NFT badges that represent oneâ€™s role
in Discord. With these badges users can claim an NFT that represent their Discord role
without actually having to disclose the association between your Discord ID and your
Ethereum Address.

This solution can facilitate the coordination within Dao members while preserving the
privacy of the single individual.
Furthermore, a lot of potential applications can be built upon that once thereâ€™s an on-chain
attestation of someoneâ€™s role in a DAO:
â€¢ Improved governance mechanism such as weighting the voting power according to
someoneâ€™s role
â€¢ Automated distribution of grants based on someoneâ€™s role
â€¢ Social media platform that relies on these badges as sybil-resistant authentication
mechanism
â€¢ On-chain resume built on these attestations

This project is currently being built for Eth Denver 22 Virtual and will be delivered by the
end of this March.

# Setup

## Env File

Create a .env file in the root of the repo for environment variables. This is .gitignored,
so it will not be applied to the repo by default.

It should contain the following variables to allow our Smart Contracts to reference PolkaDot:

```
ALCHEMY_MUMBAI_URL=foo
MUMBAI_PRIVATE_KEY=bar
```

## Python Dependencies

To manage Python dependencies, we recommend creating a virtual environment name ".venv"
in the root of the repository and installing all requirements there.

All of the requirements are detailed in `python/requirements.txt`. To install all

To create the venv, activate, and install the project requirements you run the following commands on Unix:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

And these on Windows:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: the name .venv is in the .gitignore file, so a virtual env of that name only will be ignored.
If you wish to use a different name, make sure not to commit it to the repository.

See [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) for more details.

## AWS CDK

We use the Amazon Web Services Cloud Development Kit to manage our cloud resources. All resources are defined
as Python classes, and running a "deployment" causes the cloud versions of those resources to be updated
to match the current definitions in this repository.

To deploy with the CDK, you need to have an IAM (Identity and Access Management) user with the proper permissions.
TODO: Figure out what these are.

Ask an admin to create an IAM users with API keys. Then, configure your
[credentials and config files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) with the keys
under profile name {profile_name}.

To deploy, run these commands:
```
export AWS_PROFILE={profile_name}
cdk deploy Badges --outputs-file cdk_deployment_outputs.json
```

It will ask you for your permission to deploy resources that modify IAM permissions.
Press Y and the deployment will proceed.

If the deployment fails, log into the Coudformation console using your IAM user to debug.

# Code Style

## Python

### Documentation

All functions and methods should have docstrings written according to the conventions
outlined in [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/). File and module level
docstrings are optional but nice.

### Static Type Checking

Python is a dynamic language, which adds flexibility but also makes code much more prone to type related bugs.
We use the [MyPy static type checker](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to ensure that all objects
types are combatible.

Code should be annotated using the type hints introduced in [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/).
To type check your code, run the following commands:

```
mypy .
```

The settings for MyPy are definined in the mypy.ini file in the root of the repo.


### Linting

We use the libraries [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
to enforce code style.

Black is a "code formatter" that will modify the code to standardize attributes such as string styling, line breaks,
argument formatting, and parentheses. Named for Henry Ford's quip about the Model T coming in any color you like (as
long as it's black), Black enforces a [single style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#code-style)
aiming for "consistency, generality, readability, and reducing git diffs."

Flake8 is a style guide enforcement tool that logs code in violation of certain style rules. Unlike Black it only logs
issues with code instead of modifying to resolve, but as such it can cover a wider range of violations.

To lint your code, run the following commands:

```
black .
flake8 .
```

This will first reformat the repo to be in accordance with Black's style, and then print to console all lines
that violate Flake8's style guide.

The settings for Flake8 are definined in the .flake8 file in the root of the repo.
See [here](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/using_black_with_other_tools.html#flake8) for details on how the default settins have to be
altered for compatibility with Black.

### Testing

Use [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/) for testing. Structure test cases to use [fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/explanation/fixtures.html)
to handle setup and teardown wherever possible.

There are two suites of tests: unit and integration.

To run tests, run the following command where suite is either "unit" or "integration":

```
pytest tests/{suite}
```

## Javascript

Use Typescript if possible (files end with .ts)
